For example set first image as resolution 512, with a height and width that works when you paste image into the glyph. Next image should have half resolution (256) and half height and width\nSet names of files as all “glyphname resolution.png”, eg “slightlySmilingFace 512.png”\n\n\nUse script Add sbix Images to Font to batch-import your emoji images\n\n\nThis is a mekkablue script that can be added from Plugin Manager -> Scripts"
